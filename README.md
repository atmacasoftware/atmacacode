# My Personal Website
<hr>
This website is my own website that I created from scratch. This website contains information about me, my work and my blog posts.

### Used Technologies
<hr>

* Django Framework
* MySQL
* HTML
* CSS
* JS
* Bootstrap

### Prerequisites
<hr>

There are logs you need to load. To install libraries;

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Installing
<hr>

Some precautions have been taken for security reasons in the settings.py file. In order to run the project, you need to create files named `.env` and `.env-sample` and you can review my blog post on how to create these files on my website blog.atmacacode.net.

First, the `user_accounts` app must be migrated. Because the user model has been changed, this model must be loaded into the database first.

### Deployment
<hr>

This application is currently available on Python-supported web hosting service. You can review my blog post on how to publish applications written with Django Framework on hosting services on my website blog.atmacacode.net.
